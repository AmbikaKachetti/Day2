Python Bootcamp Day3
Topic: Strings || Lists
Question 1: 
	Why Index Starting from 0?
Answer: 
	It's because of OFFSET distance.
	The distance between that particular variable from memory block.
	Here, 
		name = "Python"
		name[0] = P     // here distance between P and memory block is 0
		name[1] = y     // here distance between y and memory block is 1

	That's why in every programming Language Index is always Staring from 0 only.	
Question 2:
	How do we define an Array?
	How do we define List?
	What is the difference between List and Array in Python?
Answer: 
	Array: 	
		It's homogeneous data structure
		In array datatypes of all the element should be same. So, Array is Static Data Structure.
		Here size of the Array Fixed.
		Example: 
			[1, 2, 3, 4]
			['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
		In python Arrays are also Dynamic. we call it Numpy Array.
		Using Numpy we can create Dynamic Arrays.
S
	List:
		It's a heterogeneous data structure
		In List datatypes of all the elements doesn't need to be same. It will accept different datatypes also.
		So, List is Dynamic Data Structure.
		Here size of the List is Not Fixed.
		Example: 
			[1, 2, 'c', 4, 'd']
	
Question 3:
	What are the different List Methods?
Answer:
	Method	       Description
	append()       Adds an element at the end of the list
	insert()       Adds an element at the specified position
	remove()       Removes the first item with the specified value
	pop()	       Removes the element at the specified position
	count()	       Returns the number of elements with the specified value

	Example:       
		       0  1  2  3  4  5 <-- index positions
	
	numbersList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	
	numbersList.append(7)                     // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
	numbersList.pop()                         // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	numbersList.pop(3)			  // [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
	numbersList.count(1)                      // 1
	numbersList.remove(5)                     // [1, 2, 3, 6]
	numbersList.insert(2, 9)		 //  [1, 2, 9, 3, 6]

Leetcode Problem:
	860. Lemonade Change
Solution:
class Solution:
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills: List[int]) -> bool:
        cnt5 = 0
        cnt10 = 0
        cnt20 = 0
        for i in bills:
            if(i == 5):
                cnt5 += 1
            elif(i == 10):
                if (cnt5 > 0):
                    cnt5 -= 1
                    cnt10 += 1
                else: 
                    return False
            elif(i == 20):
                if((cnt10 > 0) and (cnt5 > 0)):
                    cnt10 -= 1
                    cnt5 -= 1
                elif(cnt5 >= 3):
                    cnt5 -= 3
                else:
                    return False
        return True

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]

Output: true

Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
