Python: It's a HighLevel, Interpreted, Dynamically Typed Language.
HighLevel: So, here we don't need to rememnber the system architecture or manage the memory
Interpreted: Code we create, run line-by-line
Dynamically Typed: It will allocate datatypes while in runtime. That's is why we don't need to specify it's datatype while initialization.

Variable: which is used to store a paticular value/word to use it through out the program.
Type Convertion Methods: 
Def: Changing an Object datatype to another datatype.
Implicit: It will automatically convert given item datatype while run time.  
Ex: num1 = 10      // <class 'int'>
    num2 = 10.2        // <class 'float'>
    sum = num1 + num2
    print(sum)        // 20.2
    print(type(sum))  // <class 'float'>

Explicit: if we wantedly make it happen.
Ex: Function       Conversion
    int()          string,float->int
    float()        string,int->float
    str()          int, float, list, tuple, dictionary -> string
    list()         string, tuple, dictionary, set -> list
    tuple()        string, list, set ->tuple
    set()          string, list, tuple -> set
    complex()      int, float -> complex
