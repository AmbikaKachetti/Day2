1. Variable: Variable is a memory container. And it's a computers way of storing data.
   Variable declaration has some rules follow: Variable Naming Conventions
	1. It shouldn't be statrted with a Number. Like 1a, 5name, 3address
	   If we gave a variable name as 1a: It will through us a Syntax Error.
	   Example: 
		    1a = 10
		    print(a)  // Syntaxerror: Invalid decimal literal

	2. It cannot starts with Special Characters like: $, @, #, &, * and Number like: 0-9
	   Example:
		   $a = 10
		   print(a)  // Syntaxerror: invalid syntax
		   1b = 11
		   print(1b) // SyntaxError: invalid syntax

	3. We can start it with letter or underscore (A-Z, a-z, _ )
	   Example: 
		   name = "Python3"
		   _a = 10
		   print(name) // Python3
		   print(a)    // 10

	4. Variable names should always be meaningful, so that it is easy to understand what kind of operation is that variable performing.
	   Example: 
		   product_of_ab = a * b
		   addition = a + b

	5. Variable names in Python are case-sensitive
	   Example: 
		   NAME
		   name
		   Name  
		All three variable names are different in Python.

2. print()
	In python we using "print()" to print the output in the console.
		We use single quotes('') or double quotes inside print to print the strings.
		Example: 
			print("Python World!")
			print('Python World!')
		If we want to print a variable that is already defined we use variable name
		Example:
			a = 11
			print(a)     // 10
			print('a')   // a
			print("a")   // a
		a = 10
		a = 'hello'
		print(a)     // hello

3. String and it's methods
	String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters.
	Example:
		name = "Python3"
		print(name[0])    // T
		print(name[1])    // y
		print(name[-1])   // 3
		print(name[::-1]) // 3nohtyP
4. Mutable vs Immutable
	Mutable: 
		Once after created we can change or modify it's value.
 		Mutable data types in Python are those whose value can be changed in place after they have been created.
		We can overwrite the original list, To append new values to our list "nums" without having to create another list. It's an in-place operation.
		
		Example: List, Set, Dictionary are Mutable

	Immutable: 
		Once it's created we can not change or modify it's value in-place.
		when multiple users want to access same data, then memory alloaction got stuck then it is a deadlock situation.
		To avoid this type of situations in memory allocation, Immutable DataStructures are designed. 
		Immutable objects shift their memory address whenever they are updated.
		Example: Integer, Float, Stings are Immutable
			a = 20
			print(id(a))      // 9756832
			a = 30
			print(id(a))	 // 9757152

4. Lists(when do we use them)
	List are used to store multiple number of values having different datatypes in a single variable.
	It's a heterogeneous data structure.
	Example: 
		nums = [1, "hello]
		print(nums.count(1))         // 1
		print(nums.append("apples")) // [1, 'hello', 'apples']
		print(nums.pop())            // [1, 'hello']
		print(nums.index(1))         // 0
